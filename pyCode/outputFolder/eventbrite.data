Those same tips, tools and techniques that come from the Bible are able to be translated into completely usable strategies for people of every background. - Rabbi Daniel Lapin- The Bible is God"s message to us.If you want to understand what God"s plans about wealth are, the Bible is the only place to look.\xe2\x80\x9cThe more things change, the more you must depend upon those things that never change\xe2\x80\x9dis a theme that the rabbi injects into his presentations. He will be teaching how you can apply principles that address the problems that plague individuals, families and our nation. He will show you how to apply these principles to your life in a practical way.Rabbi Daniel Lapin has a wealth of knowledge to share with you as he studied the Torah, physics, economics and mathematics in Johannesburg, London and Jerusalem. At this conference, you will learn the Biblical principles Rabbis and people of the Jewish faith have been using for years to become so abundantly wealthy and build continuous streams of cashflow, holistic propserity and wealth into their lives. Rabbi Daniel has a strongability to extract life principles from the Bible and transmit them in a practical, fun and entertaining manner. This is not just a boring financial conference, you will learn a lot and you will not be bored at this event!CLICK HERE to watch a video from the last Financial Conference Rabbi Daniel Lapin held in Tinley Park, IL.ABOUT DANIEL LAPIN:Rabbi Daniel Lapin, known world-wide as America\xe2\x80\x99s Rabbi, is a noted rabbinic scholar, best-selling author and host of the Rabbi Daniel Lapin Show on The Blaze Radio. He is one of America\xe2\x80\x99s most eloquent speakers and his ability to extract life principles from the Bible and transmit them in an entertaining manner has brought countless numbers of Jews and Christians closer to their respective faiths. In 2007 Newsweek magazine included him in its list of America\xe2\x80\x99s fifty most influential rabbis.Before immigrating to the United States in 1973, Rabbi Daniel Lapin studied Torah, physics, economics and mathematics in Johannesburg, London and Jerusalem. This seemingly unlikely combination forms the bedrock of his conviction that no conflict exists between the physical and spiritual, virtue and strength, or faith and wealth. He quickly became persuaded that God continues to smile on the United States of America and he became a naturalized citizen on what he describes as the proudest day of his life.Rabbi Daniel Lapin was the founding rabbi of Pacific Jewish Center, a now legendary Orthodox synagogue in Venice, California. He implanted the community\xe2\x80\x99s mission of demonstrating the relevance of traditional Faith to modern life.\xe2\x80\x9cThe more things change, the more you must depend upon those things that never change\xe2\x80\x9dis a theme that the rabbi injects into his presentations. With his compelling application of permanent principles that address the problems that plague individuals, families and our nation, he has won the admiration of noted figures such as Dr. James Dobson, John Ashcroft, Rabbi Reuven Bulka, Pastor John Hagee, Jack Kemp (1935-2009), Dr. D.J. Kennedy (1930-2007), Rush Limbaugh, Michael Medved, Rabbi Avigdor Miller (o.b.m.), the late Secretary of the Treasury, William E. Simon, Rabbi Aryeh Sheinberg, Rabbi Pinchas Stolper and Zig Ziglar. President George W. Bush appointed him to serve two terms on a United States Commission. Rabbi Lapin is a frequent speaker for hundreds of groups, institutions, organizations, and companies including Family Research Council, Legatus, Crystal Cathedral, Harvard Law School, Heritage Foundation, the United States Army, the Mont Pelerin Society of Economists, Prudential Insurance Company, the 1996 Republican National Convention, Voices United for Israel, Yeshiva University, and Young President\xe2\x80\x99s Organization. Rabbi Lapin was the keynote speaker at the Congressional Bi-Partisan opening of the 106th Congress in Washington, DC. He speaks regularly at universities, businesses and synagogues and churches throughout the country. He regularly appears on both national and local radio and television shows.Rabbi Lapin is a noted writer. His articles have appeared in theWall Street Journal, National Review, Commentary, The Jewish Press, The American Enterprise, The Washington Times, Crisis, and other publications. His first book,America\xe2\x80\x99s Real Warwas a national best seller and his second bookBuried Treasure; the Secrets for Living from the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Language,was published in 2001. His third bookThou Shall Prosper: The Ten Commandments for Making Moneypublished by John Wiley in 2002, continues selling well in America and has also been translated into Chinese and Korean. His latest project is the production of audio CD\xe2\x80\x99s that present thousands of years of Jewish wisdom emanating from the Bible, in ways that impact and improve modern day life.", "venue.address.city": "Tinley Park", "venue.longitude": "-87.8431989", "venue.address.address_1": "18500 92nd Avenue", "venue.address.postal_code": "60487", "venue.address.latitude": "41.55425080000001", "venue.address.longitude": "-87.8431989", "timezone": "America/Chicago", "id": "28286560865", "venue.address.localized_area_display": "Tinley Park, IL", "category": "Business & Professional", "utc": "2016-11-08T01:00:00Z", "venue_id": "16852878", "venue.address.region": "IL", "name": "FREE Two Day Financial Conference With Rabbi Daniel Lapin", "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/free-two-day-financial-conference-with-rabbi-daniel-lapin-tickets-28286560865?aff=ebapi", "venue.address.country": "US", "venue.latitude": "41.55425080000001", "venue.id": "16852878", "venue.address.localized_address_display": "18500 92nd Avenue, Tinley Park, IL 60487", "category_id": "101", "local": "2016-11-07T19:00:00", "venue.name": "18500 92nd Ave"}
